CS50P - Introduction to Programming with Python

notes: Lecture 0 - Functions, Variables


FUNCTIONS:   commands performing actions - called SIDE EFFECTS, e.g. print() -> displaying input
             inside parantheses is the input - called ARGUMENTS


VARIABLES:   a values can be assigned usinng '=', e.g. name = 'David'

COMMENTS:    inside a code comments can be made using '#', e.g. # Print the output
             for documentation or to-do's

print()      function for displaying in put
             input: print('hello' + 'world') output: helloworld
             print('hello', 'world') output: hello world
             CHECK ALWAYS DOCUMENTATION!!! for print(): print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False) -> default seperation is a whitespace (sep=' '), default end is a new line (end='\n')
             objects, sep, end, ... are called PARAMETERS -> difference arguments and parameters: parameters are defined in the functions definition and arguments are values being passed to the function

STR:         string variable -> text
             str can be modifided by STRING-METHODS, e.g. str.strip() -> whitspaces from the left and right of the variable are removed
             string-methdos can be linked multiple times, e.g. str.strip().title() -> whitspaces from the left and right of the variable are removed and the firt letter of every word is capitalized

F STRING     formatting string, e.g. f'hello, {name}' -> the f indidactes it is a f string and therefore, the variable name is used as input

INT          int variable -> integers
             can be used with +, -, *, /, and % operators; in python % is the modulo parameter (return remainder of a division)
             function int() can be used to convert variable into int variable

FLOAT        float variable -> floating-point number
             function float() can be used to convert variable into float variable
             float can be rounded by the function round() -> documentation: round(number[, ndigits]) -> in documentations [] means the argument is optional
             f string for float: f'{z:.2f}' -> bariable z is separated by a decimal point and has two decimal places

DEF          own function can be created with the def function
             def squared(x):        
                y = x*x
                return y
             in line 1: a function 'squared' is defined with the parameter x. parameters are optional (e.g. def squared():). default values can be added to the parameters (e.g. def squared(x=3):) parameters are only valid in                the SCOPE of the def function.
             in line 2: side effects is performed, but not values are returned out the function
             on line 3: RETURN VALUE, the value is returned out the function

             global variables can be changed inside a def function by use of the prefix 'global', e.g.:
             x = 2
             def multiple(y):
            

             def must be defined before used in the code, therefore, one option is to work with a main code:

             def main():
                 ....

             def function1():
                 ....

             main()

Working in the terminal:

code         create new code file
ls           list of all files in the current directory
cp           copy file
mv           move file
rm           delete file
mkdir        create new directory
cd           change to root directory
cd ..        change to directory one level of the directory tree up
cd <x>       change to directory <x>
rmdir        delete directory
clear        clear terminal
